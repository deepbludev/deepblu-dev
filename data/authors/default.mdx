I'm a tech enthusiast with a knack for building complex systems and innovative SaaS products. My go-to tools? Python, Rust, and Node.js.

Over the past 15 years, I've worn many hats - from diving into academic research to leading a tech company of 45 talented folks.
My journey has been a mix of geeking out over genetic algorithms and rolling up my sleeves to tackle real-world business challenges.

What gets me out of bed every morning? The thrill of pushing tech boundaries and the endless possibilities of software development. I'm always hungry to learn more and dive deeper into the latest innovations.

While I'm fluent in multiple programming languages, what really ignites my passion is collaborating with diverse teams to transform innovative ideas into groundbreaking solutions.
There's nothing more rewarding than witnessing a group of talented individuals come together, combining their unique skills and perspectives to create something truly extraordinary.

Some of the things that keep my brain buzzing:
- Designing intricate systems using cutting-edge patterns
- Exploring the frontiers of machine learning, LLMs, and MLOps
- Geeking out over DDD, CQRS, event-driven systems, and microservices
- Mastering clean code, solid architecture, and test-driven development
- Crafting SaaS products that make a real difference

My toolbox includes a mix of Python, Rust, Node.js, various databases (Postgres, DynamoDB, MongoDB), message brokers like RabbitMQ,
caching with Redis, containerization with Docker, cloud services on AWS, and frontend tech like React and Next.js.
But hey, I'm always eager to pick up new tools if they get the job done better!

I'm also a big proponent of open-source software and I'm always looking for ways to contribute to the community.
Check out my open-source projects I'm currently working on and maintaining:

- [routrs](https://github.com/routrs/routrs): **(Looking for maintainers)** Geograph-based shortest distance calculation library for Rust.
Quickly estimate the shortest distance between two points on a map via a maritime, highway or railway route... or bring your own geograph!

- [pyroutrs](https://github.com/routrs/pyroutrs): Python bindings for [routrs](https://github.com/routrs/routrs).
